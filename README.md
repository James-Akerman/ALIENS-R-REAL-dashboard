# javascript-challenge

### Background
In this Monash University Data Analytics Boot Camp/Trilogy Education Services homework, I imagined I was tasked with working for a hypothetical organisation called `ALIENS-R-REAL` which had collected all of the eye-witness reports of alien sightings.

I was tasked with writing code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](static/js/data.js) which also allowed users to filter the table data for specific values.


### Tasks
### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
For this task I did the following
* Create a basic HTML web page or using the started code file provided.

* wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects

* Used a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
